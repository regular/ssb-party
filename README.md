# ssb-party

Get a [scuttlebot][] client instance. If scuttlebot isn't running, start it in the background, and keep it running until all the clients have disconnected.

## Usage

```js
var createSsbParty = require('ssb-party')
```

### `createSsbParty([opts, ]cb)`

- `opts.keys`: an [ssb-keys][] instance. default loads from `~/.ssb/secret`
- `opts.host`: host to connect to or start the server on. default `"localhost"`
- `opts.port`: port to connect to or start the server on. default 8008
- `opts.appKey`: secret-stack capability key (Buffer). default sbot's appKey

Other properties of the `opts` object will be used as [ssb-config][]
overrides, but if the server is already running, these will not affect the existing server's config.

### Example

simplest case: connect to or start a local sbot:
```
var party = require('ssb-party')

party(function (err, sbot) {
  // ...
})
```

### Config

- `config.timers.keepalive`: minimum time (ms) to keep the server online after the last client disconnects. default: 30s
- `config.party.out`: where to put standard output of sbot. may be a path (absolute, or relative to ssb's directory), or `false` to discard, or `true` to pass through to the controlling terminal. default: `"debug.log"`
- `config.party.err`: where to put standard error of sbot. default: same as `config.party.out`
